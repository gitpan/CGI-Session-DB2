Revision history for CGI::Session::DB2

0.01
        * Original version.

0.02
        + Added more docs to the README.  Being released under the
          "release early, release often" ideology.

0.03
        + Added the ability to store timestamps for expiry.  This is
          intended to be the expiry of the entire entry.  This allows
          a simple SQL statement to remove expired sessions quickly,
          rather than loading all data, thawing, and then figuring out
          if it has expired.  NULL expiry means no expiry, just like
          C::S expects.
        + Added cleanup API
